# Nautilus
Serverless console based chat program made with PyDrive2.
# How To Use:
After installing the program files from GitHub, they can be put anywhere. Just make sure to keep all files in one place.
 
To start using Nautilus, run 'setup.py' and follow the instructions it provides. While you can run it with an IDE or something similar, I encourage you to run it with [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal#installing-and-running-windows-terminal)* (Windows) or Terminal (Mac). See [this link](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Python-File#Using-Python-at-the-Command-Line) for help on running a Python file in Windows Terminal or Terminal.

# Emojis
 Although an official list of what emojis are supported in Nautilus and their shortcodes will be coming soon, for now you can use [this website](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).


*Previously, it was encouraged to run it with the regular Command Prompt. However, with the addition of emoji support in release 2.1.0, Command Prompt is now useless because it cannot display Unicode, or at least emojis.
