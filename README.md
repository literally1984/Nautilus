# Nautilus
Console based chat program made with the PyDrive2 package.
 # How To Use:
 After installing the program files from GitHub, make sure to keep them in the Downloads folder. Also make sure that if the files are inside a folder due to extraction, move them outside the folder.
 
 To start using Nautilus, run 'chatreading.py'. While you can run it with an IDE or something similar, I encourage you to run it with Command Prompt. See [this link](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Windows-Command-Prompt-to-Run-a-Python-File) for help on running a Python file in Command Prompt.

One last thing, if after running 'chatreading.py' an error occurs and it says that there is no module named 'pydrive2', then run 'chatreading.py' again. This time, it should work.
