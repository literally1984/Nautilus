# Nautilus
Console based chat program made with the PyDrive2 package.
# How To Use:
After installing the program files from GitHub, make sure to keep them in the Downloads folder. Also, make sure that if the files are inside a folder due to extraction, move them outside the folder.
 
To start using Nautilus, run 'setup.py' and follow the instructions it provides after it installs the needed Python packages. While you can run it with an IDE or something similar, I encourage you to run it with Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac). See [this link](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Windows-Command-Prompt-to-Run-a-Python-File) for help on running a Python file in Command Prompt.
