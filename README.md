# Nautilus
Console based chat program made with the PyDrive2 package.
 # How To Use:
 After installing the program files from GitHub, make sure to keep them in the Downloads folder. Also make sure that if the files are inside a folder due to extraction, move them outside the folder.
 
 To start using Nautilus, run 'chatreading.py'. While you can run it with an IDE or something similar, I encourage you to run it with Command Prompt. See [this link](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Windows-Command-Prompt-to-Run-a-Python-File) for help on running a Python file in Command Prompt.
